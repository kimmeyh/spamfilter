please write an algorithm to export the current json_rules (see rest of program for reference
to what the JSON looks like and example file @rules.yaml).
The rules.yaml needs to be accurate in output and format.
Then update get_yaml_rules, to read in from YAML_RULES_FILE so that it exactly match json_rules prior ot export.
ONLY change code that HAS to be CHANGED to implement the recommendation.
Any code that should be removed should be commented out and not deleted.
Do not remove any commented out code.


Can you update get_safe_senders_rules to read in the safe_senders file and make a separate JSON variable for the

Can you create a protobuf schema for rules_new.yaml
